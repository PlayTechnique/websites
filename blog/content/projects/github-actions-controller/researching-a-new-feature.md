title: "Researching a New Feature"

Desired new feature: have one installation of the controller serve multiple user repositories.

Starting inside the runner image, it's defined in actions-runner-controller. Its [entrypoint script](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/runner/entrypoint.sh)
executes startup.sh pretty quickly.

Startup.sh looks like it concatenates 2 env vars to register its callback into github:

GITHUB_URL is either the public github URL or a github enterprise server URL.
ATTACH is the key here. It's built from other variables, because it's always turtles all the way down:

```bash
if [ -n "${RUNNER_ORG}" ] && [ -n "${RUNNER_REPO}" ] && [ -n "${RUNNER_ENTERPRISE}" ]; then
  ATTACH="${RUNNER_ORG}/${RUNNER_REPO}"
elif [ -n "${RUNNER_ORG}" ]; then
  ATTACH="${RUNNER_ORG}"
elif [ -n "${RUNNER_REPO}" ]; then
  ATTACH="${RUNNER_REPO}"
elif [ -n "${RUNNER_ENTERPRISE}" ]; then
  ATTACH="enterprises/${RUNNER_ENTERPRISE}"
else
  log.error 'At least one of RUNNER_ORG, RUNNER_REPO, or RUNNER_ENTERPRISE must be set'
  exit 1
fi
```
from https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/runner/startup.sh#L35

RUNNER_ORG and RUNNER_REPO are handed in as values in the pod file definition.

# Hypothesis
If I can have 2 RUNNER_REPO entries in the pod definition, and have the controller recognise there are multiple repos
defined, then I can have the controller spin up 1 runner per RUNNER_REPO.
