Everyone reinvents the wheel.

Every job I've had that's used github enterprise, someone's written a CLI tool to query the github API and get a list
of pending PRs. It's a weird oversight in the `gh` CLI tool that it isn't covered.

Anyway, other people I've known have usually written that cli tool. I figure it's my turn, and this time it'll be Free 
Software under an MIT license.
