I got into my car this morning to drive to a mountain to hike that mountain.

Three quarters of the way to the mountain, my check engine light turned on. Last time I had a check engine warning, my car refused to start.

I drove back home. All I achieved was wasting fuel, adding to the misery of the humans on Earth.
