I found a blog post from someone apparently in London (though the written prose reminds me of people I've worked with in Hydrabad)
about the sort of Jenkins configurations that I'm thinking of doing. It's a series of 3 articles which starts here: https://ifritltd.com/2017/07/06/dockerize-jenkins-2-setup-with-sonarqube-declarative-build-pipeline/

I've been following things I've learned from work, so it was neat seeing someone else trying to do something similar, especially as the third article
in his series contains code for programatically loading credentials files!

The first place I read about ideas for automating Jenkins with groovy was this guy's blog: https://cicd.life/u3-p1-intro-jenkins-groovy-init-system/
He was my predecessor in my current position; he had come up with most of the ideas in the system, it seems like.
