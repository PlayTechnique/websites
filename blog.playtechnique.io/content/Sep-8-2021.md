Title: Jinkies Transcrypting Secrets Addition

At work we use this neat shell script [transcrypt](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt) to automatically encrypt 
and decrypt secrets when we push a git repo to github.

I sat down and figured that out today for jinkies. It's been fun applying this sort of weird niche knowledge to an 
actual project that I'm trying to build out. 

With this in, I can commit the (not very sensitive) secrets I need in the repository, 

My plan is to configure github credentials using the Jenkins UI, then go visit the Jenkins Configuration as Code
management page and export the elements of the yaml file that represent the auth config to a file in the git repository. 
This file will be installed to the target of the CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG environment variable using the Dockerfile, and now
we _should_ have a github secret that gets rebuilt into the container on every rebuild.

Later addition:

Thinking about the above strategy, I'm pretty sure it won't work for me. I will not know the yaml entries for the 
github token that an end user provides to me, as it contains the output of some encryption algorithms.

Curses.

Time to head back to the drawing board, Gwyn.
