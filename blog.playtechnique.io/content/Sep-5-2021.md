Title: Jenkins Plans

I've started fiddling with getting Jenkins into a self-hosted appropriate, easy to configure setup.

Kind of launching off from https://cicd.life/tutorials/, I'm working on cli interface that:

* starts up Jenkins with no login needed
* With a github url provided on the cli:
    * Jenkins will have reached out to that URL to find a Jenkinsfile
    * If a Jenkinsfile is discovered, build a job from that Jenkinsfile 

You can see progress towards this on https://github.com/gwynforthewyn/jinkies-composed at commit 0bef81157435fae81eba6b7014944c3bc5f9680e

There's a folder build_zone which contains two scripts, build_image and run_jenkins. When the image is built and jenkins is
run, the user can visit http://localhost:8080 and see a Jenkins instance running with no authentication needed.
