So I started a new blog. Here's the blockers to getting it up online:

|idea                                    |rationale|Questions|
|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| self-host inside a container           |I want to be able to use Amazon's container service for something ||
| only host static html inside container |I can serve this with nginx just fine, and it lowers the tech footprint ||
| use a minimalist container             |Tiny containers are more betterer | Is there something more minimal than alpine? ||
| self-hosted build system               |I want to maintain access to simple build systems ||
| write a Jenkinsfile for the build      |I should learn how to generate builds quickly ||
